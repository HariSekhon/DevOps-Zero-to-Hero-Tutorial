## Linux Basics

Linux is the standard open source operating system, based on Unix design. 

Everything is a file on Linux, even devices. 

The Linux command line is extremely powerful and there are several shells to choose from. The default shell is Bash, which is based on the Bourne shell (Bash stands for Bourne again shell). Other popular shells include ZSH and Fish.

## Command Basics

- `cd` - change directory
- `ls -l` - list files and directories
- `cat` - reads the contents of the file to the terminal
- `echo` - prints a given string argument
- `>` -  overwrite file
